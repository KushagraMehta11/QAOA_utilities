# QAOA Utilities and Introduction

This repository contains resources for implementing and exploring the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). It includes a Jupyter Notebook (`qaoa_utilities_intro.ipynb`) and a Python module (`qaoa_utilities.py`) with utility functions for QAOA and graph-based problems like the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

## Overview

The **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed for solving combinatorial optimization problems. This repository provides:

1. **`qaoa_utilities_intro.ipynb`**:
   - A step-by-step introduction to QAOA.
   - Explanation of QAOA parameters and optimization techniques.
   - Examples demonstrating QAOA on small graph problems.

2. **`qaoa_utilities.py`**:
   - Utility functions for graph creation, visualization, and manipulation.
   - Helper methods for encoding optimization problems into Ising Hamiltonians.
   - Tools for analyzing and visualizing QAOA results.

## Features

- **Graph Operations**: Create, manipulate, and plot graphs with edge weights and positions.
- **QAOA Utilities**:
  - Generate cost Hamiltonians for graph-based optimization problems.
  - Analyze and visualize optimization results, including probabilities and energy landscapes.
- **TSP Support**: Specialized functions for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem using QAOA.

## Requirements

To use the notebook and utilities, you need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `networkx`
  - `sympy` (for symbolic computation)
  - `qiskit` or another quantum computing framework

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib networkx sympy qiskit
